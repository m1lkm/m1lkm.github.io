#### _I like milk, there is something intimate about it._

Having some game ideas I'm going to write them down below:

#### _Robot nurse_

Protagonist created or gets their hands on a prototype lactating robot meant to serve as a wet nurse for newborns. After solving a series of technical difficulties with the project the protagonist becomes obsessed with adult breastfeeding.

Technical challenges and solutions could be:
1. Gentle milk warming up and temp maintenance system inside of her milkers (infrared lights and thermometers with an electronic controller)
2. Cleansing and sterilization of robotic beasts and nipples (maintenance flushing with water based solution and high temperature heating after each feed session)
3. Loading of refrigerated milk bags or jugs (secretion of milk as an advanced sci-fi feature)

Make them appealing an interesting to the player - it has to have a profound influence on gameplay somehow. Putting pen to paper does change everything.
In fact now I think about a more abstract and universal solution.

#### _Tech tree for the nurse robot maid:_
|_lvl_| Brain        | Milk Unit                      | Actuators         | Batteries       |
| --- | ------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------- | --------------- |
| 1   | ESP32        | Manual operation & maintenance | Stepper motors    | Lithium-ion     |
| 2   | STM32        | Auto maintenance routines      | Servo motors      | Lithium Polymer |
| 3   | SBC          | Milk production                | Custom BLDC & ESC | Solid-State     |

So what if we can put robot to work to breastfeed babies and..jeez
